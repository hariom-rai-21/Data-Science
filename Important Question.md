## 1. What is Data Science? Explain its benefits.
### Answer: Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses statistics, algorithms, and machine learning to analyze data and extract insights. Its benefits include better decision-making, predictive analytics, process automation, fraud detection, and personalized customer experiences. By uncovering hidden patterns and trends, it helps businesses innovate, improve efficiency, and gain a competitive advantage in their domain.

## 2.Differentiate Business Intelligence (BI) and Data Science.
### Answer:Business Intelligence focuses on analyzing historical data to generate reports, dashboards, and performance metrics for decision-making. Data Science, on the other hand, goes beyond descriptive analysis by using predictive and prescriptive models, machine learning, and advanced analytics to forecast future outcomes. BI answers “what happened,” while Data Science explores “what will happen” or “why it happens.”
